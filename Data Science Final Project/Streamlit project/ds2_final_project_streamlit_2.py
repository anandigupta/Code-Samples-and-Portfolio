"""
Climate change has been declared the "single biggest health threat facing humanity," according to the World Health Organization ([link](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-change-health-threat-who/)). Increasingly frequent climate disasters such as heat waves, storms and floods, as well as the disruption of food systems, the spread of diseases from animal populations, food- and water-borne illnesses, and related mental health issues pose major threats to human health.

Although climate change is a global crisis, it will disproportionately affect certain regions, in part due to geographic reasons that make them more vulnerable to extreme weather events, as well as because of socio-economic factors such as the reliance on natural resource intensive industries such as agriculture and the lack of strong institutions and coping capacity. This dashboard enables users to explore geographic differences in contributions to climate change as well as the direct and indirect effects of climate change (particularly on health).

    Climate change is unequivocally exacerbating global inequalities. Wealthier countries have historically contributed to the majority of global emissions, and reaped the direct economic benefits associated with fossil fuel use. However, research shows that for most poor countries (which are overwhelmingly located in hotter areas such as Africa, the Indian Subcontinent, and Southeast Asia, and rely highly on the agriculture sector), there is >90% likelihood that per capita GDP is lower today than if global warming had not occurred ([link](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1816020116)). These countries additionally have limited coping capacity for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events, which puts their populations at extreme risk for premature deaths and poor health outcomes. Within these countries, climate change will again have unequal impacts, such that the poorest will suffer the most.

    Progressive policies are thus imperative for addressing the unequal distribution of climate change impacts. Potential policy tools include:
    1) Stricter emissions targets for wealthier countries
    2) Relief packages for poorer countries facing climate disasters and provision of asylum to climate refugees
    3) Reduction of fossil fuel subsidies and a reallocation of budgets to progressive welfare distribution within countries
    4) Carbon pricing and reinvestment of revenues into healthcare and other essential infrastructure

    This list is not exhaustive, and there remains an urgent need for the development of new and innovative policy tools to combat the unequal global impacts of climate change.
